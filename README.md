### Portfolio 1
### My First Website!

**About This Site :**

This is my very first website, which I built from scratch.
I tried to apply knowledges of HTML and CSS which I gained from Hacktiv8 Coding Bootcamp online preparation class.
They call this class as Phase-0, which divided into 6 weeks. Each week consists of fundamental knowledges, which will
be useful as a foundation for the upcoming immersive on-site coding class, later on after finishing Phase-0.
